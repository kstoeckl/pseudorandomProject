# pseudorandomProject
(In progress) A pseudo-random number generator web app, based off user input.

The end goal is to have a web application that feeds off the input of multiple simultaneous users, converting this into a seed
for a prng (at this stage an xor-shift alg). The output will then be displayed for the users with some nice formating thrown 
in for good measure.
